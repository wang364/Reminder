1. Practice Random Acts of Kindness

Dr. Wilson, Warren's father, did not have to loan us his car and give us money to attend the demonstrations, but he did so out of the pure grace of his heart. Being surrounded by an extraordinary family like the Wilsons afforded me some invaluable opportunities that I never would’ve had otherwise. The Wilsons helped me tap into my own unique and unlimited potential — and they knew the true value of a kind word, touch, gesture and smile. They taught me early on that people will always remember how you made them feel. Their generosity forever changed my life and shaped my outlook on serving others.

2. The Preciousness of Time: Arrive Early

Success does not have business hours. It only has production hours. Lessons are constantly presented to us each day, and it is our responsibility as leaders to remain cognizant of these opportunities for growth. If we focus on the present and what is actually in our control, we can create tremendous momentum in our lives and the lives of those we lead. The process is never merely a destination but a transformative journey of self-discovery. The only thing that is ever guaranteed is this moment.

3. Embrace the Unknown: Maximize the Moment

We hear it constantly, but we have a duty to make the most of every opportunity we are afforded. Each day is a gift, an interview, a new story, a celebration, a blank canvas, an intellectual journey and a negotiation. We cannot allow events to pass us by, even if the time, funding and circumstances are not entirely right. We must use our 86,400 seconds each day to maximize our potential as positive-difference makers in the life of another.

4. Never Be Afraid to Ask For What You Want

One of life’s most significant challenges is to differentiate between what the world expects of us and what we expect of ourselves. If we simply strive to be normal, we will never know how transcendent we can actually become. We must see what others do not, and do and ask what others are afraid to. We must look beyond what is and toward what can be — and, even further, into what should be.

5. Leaving A Legacy: Servant Leadership

At the end of each day, our fundamental responsibility is to serve those we lead. With that as the foundation, we figure out the needs of our teams, as well as the needs of its individual members. The needs in Selma might have been different than the needs in Jackson, Mississippi, or the needs of those in Detroit and D.C. As we go along, the one thing that must become abundantly clear for us as servant leaders is that it is never about "Me" and always about "We." It becomes incumbent upon us to reflect on the question: “How can I best serve the needs of my team?”

6. The Power Of A Dream

The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom is still a constant reminder to me of the real value a dream has and the responsibilities that come with having one. I have learned from Dr. King to be a dream maker — to assist people in turning their dreams into realities. There is no question that August 28, 1963, was a day that inspired and empowered me to re-evaluate how I lived and what I believed my contributions to society should be.
